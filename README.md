Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models are powerful tools used in drug discovery to predict the biological activity of small molecules. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in building QSAR models because they can learn patterns and relationships in large datasets. In this context, I present a QSAR model built using machine learning, trained on the ChEMBL target database for Leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) molecule.

LRRK2 is a protein kinase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The ChEMBL database provides a comprehensive collection of pharmacological and bioactivity data for a range of small molecule compounds, making it an ideal resource for training a QSAR model. By downloading the ChEMBL target database for LRRK2, we can develop a predictive model that accurately predicts the bioactivity of novel compounds with similar structural features.

In this project, we leveraged machine learning algorithms to build a QSAR model that can predict the potency of compounds in terms of their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against the LRRK2 target. Our model takes into account various chemical descriptors, such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area, and number of rotatable bonds, to accurately predict the biological activity of compounds. The resulting model can potentially aid in the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders.
